➢ Designed a pair of smart glasses based on Raspberry Pi, which can realize the remote transmission of information (video, 
audio, text, photo, image and voice control), and real-time fault detection in the smart glasses terminal to give feedback for 
better maintenance.<br>
➢ Improved the YOLOV4-tiny target detection algorithm such as proposing a new network structure and postprocess approach 
to have higher accuracy and high computational speed, and GAN algorithm is used to create my own Insulator-Defect 
Datasets. Eventually I deploy it on Raspberry Pi for real-time transmission line fault detection<br>
➢ Alibaba Cloud server is used to build NodeJS server, and STUN / TURN server was used to achieve NAP penetration of two 
devices in different network environments.<br>
➢ Used Webrtc to easily implement voice and video calls. For the function of taking photos, the canvas command is used to
intercept and draw the video in the video frame. Base64 encoding is used to encode the picture which is transmitted through 
p2p together with text.<br>
