➢ Designed a multi-band, wide-band, high-gain microstrip antenna to efficiently collect RF energy in the frequency band mainly at 915MHz or 2.4GHz, and designed a matching circuit and voltage doubler rectification circuit which finally enables the system to be applied to low-power devices such as Zigbee.<br>
➢ Researched the application of metamaterials technology in antennas to achieve better performance while ensuring miniaturization, and used intelligent algorithms for antenna structure<br>
