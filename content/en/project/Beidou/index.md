➢ Designed a software that uses “BeiDou” data transparent transmission to realize the reading of various sensor data in remote 
environments through wireless transmission and real-time monitoring of the environment.</br>
➢ Used QtCreator software for the development (Qt uses C++ for programming), RS485 bus to read data by wire, and then
connectted BeDou to realize BeiDou communication.</br>
➢ On the basis of the RS485 bus, three different sensors can be read and recorded at one time. The sensor to be read and the 
corresponding reading interval can be set separately. The function of automatically searching the port and configuring the
device number is realized.. On the basis of realizing wired reading, BeiDou transparent transmission is used to achieve short-range wireless data collection</br>
