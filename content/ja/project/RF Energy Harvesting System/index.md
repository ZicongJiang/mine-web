summary = """
  Design a multi-band, wide-band, high-gain microstrip antenna so that it can efficiently collect RF energy in the frequency band mainly at 915MHz or 2.4GHz, and design a matching circuit and voltage doubler rectification circuit which finally enables the system to be applied to low-power devices such as Zigbee:<br>
 1).  Use algorithms to find the best structure and the best type of semiconductor of the circuit.<br>
 2).  Research the application of metamaterials technology in antennas to achieve better performance while ensuring miniaturization, and use intelligent algorithms for antenna structure.
