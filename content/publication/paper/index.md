# Abstract.
#abstract = "In the traditonal transmission device inspection, the  managers that are in remote management center can not master the work of transmission inspectors. When the transmission inspectors met some difficult problems, they can only use moble telephone to communicate with remote experts by voice communication. Due to that the remote experts can not see the fiel image, the remote experts can not give accurate guidance to solve the problems in some times. Especially, when the transmission inspectors work on high voltage transmission tower, they are not permitted to carry telephone. This limits the communication betwen the transmission inspectors and remote experts. To solve this problem, we design a transmission line inspection auxiliary management system based on rasperry pi. It is a wearble devices, and easily fixed to helmet or eyeglass frame. The remote experts or managers can use the system to communicatie with the field transmission inspectors by voice or video. The  remote experts can mater the filed image at any time, and send usefully information to help the transmission inspectors to solve some difficult problem. The transimission inspectors can see the received information by a mirco display. The system realizes the  remote visual supervision and guidance for transmission device inspection."

# Abstract.
#abstract = "The "You only look once v4"(YOLOv4) is one type of object detection methods in deep learning. YOLOv4-tiny is proposed based on YOLOv4 to simple the network structure and reduce parameters, which makes it be suitable for developing on the mobile and embedded devices. To improve the real-time of object detection, a fast object detection method is proposed based on YOLOv4-tiny. It firstly uses two ResBlock-D modules in ResNet-D network instead of two CSPBlock modules in Yolov4-tiny, which reduces the computation complexity. Secondly, it designs an auxiliary residual network block to extract more feature information of object to reduce detection error. In the design of auxiliary network, two consecutive 3x3 convolutions are used to obtain 5x5 receptive fields to extract global features, and channel attention and spatial attention are also used to extract more effective information. In the end, it merges the auxiliary network and backbone network to construct the whole network structure of improved YOLOv4-tiny. Simulation results show that the proposed method has faster object detection than YOLOv4-tiny and YOLOv3-tiny, and almost the same mean value of average precision as the YOLOv4-tiny. It is more suitable for real-time object detection."
