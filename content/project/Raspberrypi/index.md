# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = """
 1).  Design a pair of smart glasses based on Raspberry Pi, which can realize the remote transmission of information (video, audio, text, photo, image and voice control), and real-time fault detection in the smart glasses terminal to give feedback for better maintenance.<br>
 2).  Improving the YOLOV4-tiny target detection algorithm such as proposing a new network structure or improving postprocess approach to have higher accuracy and high computational speed, and training my own training set before deploying it on Raspberry Pi for real-time transmission line fault detection.<br>
 3).  Remote login to Alibaba Cloud server to build NodeJS server, and use STUN / TURN server to achieve NAP penetration of two devices in different network environments.<br>
 4).  Webrtc can be used to easily implement voice and video calls. The camera function uses the canvas command to intercept and draw the video in the video frame. Base64 encoding is used to encode the picture which is transmitted through p2p together with text.
