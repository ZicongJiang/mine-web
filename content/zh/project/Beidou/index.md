summary = """
1). Design a software that uses “BeiDou” data transparent transmission to realize the reading of various sensor data in remote environments through wireless transmission and real-time monitoring of the environment.<br>
2). Use QtCreator software for the development (Qt uses C++ for programming). Before using BeiDou transparent transmission, first realize the method of using RS485 bus to read data by wire, and then connect BeDou to realize BeiDou communication.<br>
3). On the basis of the RS485 bus, three different sensors can be read and recorded at one time, and the sensor to be read and the corresponding reading interval can be set separately. Then realize the function of automatically searching the port and configuring the device number. On the basis of realizing wired reading, use BeiDou transparent transmission to achieve short-range wireless data collection.
